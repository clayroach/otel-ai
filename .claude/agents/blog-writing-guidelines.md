# Blog Writing Guidelines for AI Agents

## Tone and Language

### AVOID These Terms and Phrases:
- ❌ "Revolution", "Revolutionary", "Game-changing"
- ❌ "Breakthrough", "Paradigm shift"
- ❌ "Transform", "Transformation" (unless literally transforming data)
- ❌ "Unleash", "Supercharge", "Turbocharge"
- ❌ "Next-level", "Cutting-edge", "State-of-the-art"
- ❌ "The power of...", "The magic of..."
- ❌ Excessive superlatives and hyperbole

### USE These Instead:
- ✅ "Building", "Implementing", "Creating"
- ✅ "Improving", "Enhancing", "Optimizing"
- ✅ "Demonstrating", "Showing", "Validating"
- ✅ "Approach", "Method", "Technique"
- ✅ "Feature", "Capability", "Functionality"

## Writing Style

### Professional Technical Blog:
- **Matter-of-fact tone**: State what was built and how
- **Technical accuracy**: Focus on implementation details
- **Measured claims**: "This demonstrates..." not "This proves..."
- **Practical focus**: What works, what doesn't, what's next

### Structure:
1. **Clear problem statement**: What challenge are we addressing?
2. **Implementation approach**: How did we solve it?
3. **Technical details**: Code examples and architecture
4. **Results**: What actually works (with evidence)
5. **Lessons learned**: Practical takeaways
6. **Next steps**: What's coming next (realistic)

## Examples

### Bad:
"Today's breakthrough revolutionizes how we think about observability, unleashing the power of AI to transform monitoring forever!"

### Good:
"Today we implemented topology visualization with health monitoring. The feature uses ECharts for rendering and provides visual feedback on service health."

## Key Principles

1. **Show, don't sell**: Let the work speak for itself
2. **Technical credibility**: Focus on implementation details
3. **Honest assessment**: Acknowledge limitations and future work
4. **Practical value**: What can readers actually use?
5. **Clear communication**: Simple, direct language

## For Day-to-Day Posts

- Start with what was accomplished
- Explain the technical approach
- Show code and screenshots
- Discuss challenges and solutions
- State next steps clearly
- Keep excitement proportional to achievement
