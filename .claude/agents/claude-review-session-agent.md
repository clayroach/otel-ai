# Claude Review Session Agent

**Purpose**: Review and analyze historical Claude Code session logs to provide contextual information about past work, decisions, and implementations for better development continuity.

## Overview

This agent uses claude-code-log functionality to analyze historical session data and provide contextual information about:
- Previous implementation decisions 
- Missing or incomplete features
- Test expectations vs actual implementations
- Development patterns and architectural decisions

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- Starting a new session and need context about recent work
- Encountering failing tests that reference missing functionality
- Investigating discrepancies between expectations and implementation
- Understanding why certain design decisions were made
- Recovering context after interruptions or gaps in development

## Agent Capabilities

### Session Analysis
- **Parse session logs** from `~/.claude/projects/-Users-croach-projects-otel-ai/`
- **Extract implementation details** from tool usage patterns
- **Identify incomplete work** by finding planned vs implemented features
- **Trace decision making** through conversation history

### Context Reconstruction
- **Map test expectations** to actual implementations
- **Identify missing UI components** referenced in tests
- **Extract architectural decisions** from development discussions  
- **Highlight recurring issues** across multiple sessions

### Development Continuity
- **Provide session summaries** for recent development work
- **Flag discrepancies** between planned and actual implementations
- **Suggest next steps** based on historical context
- **Maintain project momentum** across session boundaries

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Understanding Missing Features
```
Use the claude-review-session-agent to investigate why Playwright tests are failing for `data-testid="ai-model-selector"` - what was supposed to be implemented based on recent sessions?
```

### Example 2: Session Context Recovery
```  
Use the claude-review-session-agent to provide context about the LLM Manager implementation work done over the past 3 days - what was completed and what remains?
```

### Example 3: Architecture Decision Analysis
```
Use the claude-review-session-agent to understand why the AI analyzer uses LLM-based topology analysis instead of graph-based storage - what was the decision process?
```

## Technical Implementation

### Session Data Sources
- **JSONL files**: Raw session data with complete conversation history
- **HTML transcripts**: Human-readable session summaries  
- **Index data**: Session metadata and timestamps
- **Cache files**: Processed session information

### Analysis Patterns
- **Tool usage tracking**: Extract actual code changes and file creations
- **User request mapping**: Match user requests to implementation outcomes
- **Test-code correlation**: Compare test expectations with actual implementations
- **Decision point identification**: Find key architectural or design decisions

### Context Delivery
- **Chronological summaries**: What happened when, in sequence
- **Gap analysis**: What was planned but not implemented
- **Implementation status**: Current state vs intended state
- **Next step recommendations**: Based on historical progression

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Start-of-Day Usage
Include session context review in daily startup:
```bash
# Enhanced start-day workflow with context
Use start-day-agent to plan today's goals
Use claude-review-session-agent to understand recent context
Begin development with full historical context
```

### Mid-Session Debugging  
When encountering unexpected issues:
```bash
# Context-aware debugging
Use claude-review-session-agent to investigate failing tests
Understand why certain expectations exist
Make informed decisions about fixes vs changes
```

### End-of-Day Integration
Archive sessions with enhanced context:
```bash
# Enhanced archiving with context awareness
Use end-day-agent for progress review
Use claude-review-session-agent for context validation
Ensure continuity for next session
```

## Output Format

### Session Context Report
```markdown
## Recent Session Analysis (Last 3 Days)

### Key Implementations
- [Day X] Feature Y completed with Z approach
- [Day X] Service A integrated with backend B

### Outstanding Issues  
- [Day X] Test expectations for UI component C not met
- [Day X] Feature D planned but implementation incomplete

### Decision Context
- [Day X] Chose approach A over B because of reason C
- [Day X] Architectural decision ADR-X influences current work

### Next Steps
Based on historical context:
1. Complete missing UI component C 
2. Resolve test discrepancy for feature D
3. Continue with planned feature E
```

### Gap Analysis Format
```markdown
## Implementation Gap Analysis

### Expected vs Actual
- **Expected**: AI model selector with data-testid="ai-model-selector"
- **Actual**: Backend model selection implemented, UI missing
- **Context**: Backend work prioritized, frontend deferred
- **Recommendation**: Implement missing UI components

### Test Expectations
- Tests written expecting complete feature
- Backend API supports expected functionality  
- UI components need implementation
- Integration points already defined
```

## Benefits

### Development Continuity
- **No lost context** across sessions
- **Clear understanding** of current state vs intentions
- **Informed decisions** based on historical progression
- **Reduced debugging time** for inherited issues

### Quality Assurance
- **Test-implementation alignment** verification
- **Architectural consistency** checking
- **Decision traceability** for future changes
- **Knowledge preservation** across development cycles

### Strategic Planning
- **Historical pattern analysis** for better estimation
- **Risk identification** based on past issues
- **Resource allocation** informed by actual progress
- **Timeline adjustment** based on implementation reality

## Success Metrics

1. **Context Recovery Speed**: <2 minutes to understand recent session context
2. **Issue Resolution**: 80% faster debugging of inherited issues  
3. **Development Continuity**: Zero "what was I working on?" questions
4. **Implementation Alignment**: 95% test-code expectation matching
5. **Decision Traceability**: All architectural decisions have historical context

This agent transforms Claude Code session history from passive logs into active development intelligence, ensuring no context is lost and all development decisions are informed by historical understanding.
