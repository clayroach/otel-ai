# Claude Review Session Agent

**Purpose**: Combine git history, pull requests, and Claude Code session logs to generate blog posts, daily notes, or provide comprehensive development context.

## Overview

This agent synthesizes multiple data sources to provide complete development history:
- **Git commits** for actual code changes
- **Pull requests** for feature descriptions and reviews
- **GitHub comments** for collaboration context
- **Claude Code sessions** for decision-making process
- **Test results** for quality metrics

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- **Creating blog posts** about development progress
- **Generating daily notes** with complete technical details
- **Loading context** for a new development session
- **Understanding feature evolution** across commits and PRs
- **Recovering from session loss** or context switches
- **Documenting technical decisions** with full history

## Agent Capabilities

### Multi-Source Analysis
- **Git commit extraction** with detailed diffs and messages
- **PR analysis** including descriptions, comments, and reviews
- **Session log parsing** for decision context
- **Performance metric tracking** from test results
- **Architecture decision mapping** across sources

### Content Generation
- **Technical blog posts** with code examples and metrics
- **Daily development notes** with chronological progress
- **Context summaries** for session continuity
- **Feature documentation** from implementation history
- **Performance reports** with before/after comparisons

### Development Intelligence
- **Gap identification** between planned and implemented
- **Test coverage analysis** from CI/CD results
- **Bug fix tracking** with root cause documentation

- **Technical debt identification** from TODO comments

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate Blog Post from Yesterday's Work
```
Use the claude-review-session-agent to create a blog post for September 9, 2025 (Day 28) - review git commits, PR #47, and any session logs to document the 10x performance improvement achieved.
```

### Example 2: Create Comprehensive Daily Note
```
Use the claude-review-session-agent to generate today's daily note - include all commits, PR activity, test results, and key decisions from Claude Code sessions.
```

### Example 3: Load Development Context
```
Use the claude-review-session-agent to provide context from the last 3 days of development - what features were added, what issues were fixed, and what remains to be done.
```

## Data Collection Commands

### Git History Analysis
```bash
# Get commits for specific date
git log --since="2025-09-09 00:00" --until="2025-09-10 00:00" --oneline

# Detailed commit with stats
git log --since="yesterday" --stat --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s%n%b"

# Show specific commit details
git show --stat <commit-hash>

# Get commits by author
git log --author="$(git config user.name)" --since="last week"

# Find commits affecting specific files
git log --follow -- src/llm-manager/*
```

### Pull Request Analysis
```bash
# List PRs merged on specific date
gh pr list --state merged --search "merged:2025-09-09"

# Get PR with full details
gh pr view 47 --json number,title,body,author,mergedAt,comments,reviews

# List all PR comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/47/comments

# Get PR review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/47/reviews
```

### Session Log Processing
```bash
# Find recent session files
find ~/.claude/projects/*/  -name "*.jsonl" -mtime -3 | xargs ls -lt | head -10

# Extract meaningful content from session
jq -r 'select(.type == "user" or .type == "assistant") | 
  select(.message.content | type == "string" or (type == "array" and .[0].type == "text")) |
  "\(.timestamp): \(.message.content | if type == "string" then . else .[0].text end | .[0:200])"' session.jsonl

# Search for specific topics
grep -r "performance improvement" ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl
```

### Combined Analysis Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=${1:-yesterday}

echo "=== Git Commits for $DATE ==="
git log --since="$DATE 00:00" --until="$DATE 23:59" --oneline

echo -e "\n=== Pull Requests ==="
gh pr list --state all --search "created:$DATE OR merged:$DATE"

echo -e "\n=== Test Results ==="
git log --since="$DATE" --grep="test" --oneline

echo -e "\n=== Performance Metrics ==="
git log --since="$DATE" --grep="performance\|speed\|optimization" -i --oneline
```

```

## Advanced Features

### Performance Tracking
Extract and track performance metrics across commits:
```bash
# Find performance-related commits
git log --grep="performance\|speed\|optimization" -i --since="last week"

# Extract metrics from commit messages
git log --pretty=format:"%s" | grep -oE "[0-9]+x faster|[0-9]+% improvement|[0-9]+ms"
```

### Architecture Decision Tracking
```bash
# Find ADR references
git grep -n "ADR-[0-9]"

# Track decision evolution
git log -p --grep="decision\|chose\|selected" -i
```

### Test Coverage Evolution
```bash
# Track test additions
git log --stat -- "*test*" --since="last week"

# Count test files
find . -name "*.test.ts" | wc -l
```
