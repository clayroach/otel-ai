## Process

### 1. Screenshot Organization (Date-Based Workflow)
- Check the `notes/screenshots/YYYY-MM-DD/` folder for relevant screenshots
- If screenshots are still in `screenshots-dropbox/`, move to daily folder with proper naming:
  - `pr-{PR-number}-{description}.png` for PR-specific screenshots
  - `feature-{package}-{description}.png` for feature documentation
  - Analyze screenshots to determine purpose and PR relevance
- Create PR-specific copies with `pr-{PR-number}-` prefix for this PR
- Update screenshot README in daily folder with PR context
- Reference organized screenshots in PR description with proper paths

### 2. Package Documentation Updates
- Review recent code changes across all packages
- Update `notes/packages/[package]/package.md` files to reflect:
  - New features implemented
  - Architecture changes
  - UI improvements
  - API modifications
- Ensure documentation matches current implementation
- Add references to organized screenshots

### 3. Design Documentation
- Update `notes/design.md` with architectural decisions made
- Document significant design trade-offs or improvements
- Record any new patterns or conventions

### 4. PR Creation
- Generate comprehensive PR title and description including:
  - Feature overview with hero screenshot
  - Technical changes summary
  - Before/after comparisons where applicable
  - Testing instructions
  - Documentation updates
  - References to updated package docs

### 5. Blog Entry Preparation
- Identify if work warrants a blog post
- Create/update daily journal entry
- Prepare blog post outline with:
  - Hero image from screenshots
  - Technical explanation
  - Code examples
  - Visual demonstrations
  - Links to PR and documentation

Start by scanning screenshots-dropbox folder and suggesting organization structure, then proceed systematically through each step.
