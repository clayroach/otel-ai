### Related Issues
<!-- Use parent/child relationships for feature hierarchies -->
- Parent Feature: # <!-- For sub-features (e.g., Feature-005a has parent Feature-005) -->
- Child Features: # <!-- For parent features listing their sub-features -->
- Depends on: #
- Blocks: #
- Related to: #

### Notes on Parent/Child Relationships
<!--
Parent/child relationships help organize complex features:
- Parent features define the overall capability (e.g., Feature-005: Diagnostics UI)
- Child features implement specific aspects (e.g., Feature-005a: OTLP Capture, Feature-005b: Annotations)
- Child features reference their parent for context
- Parent features list their children for completeness
