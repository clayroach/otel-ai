# CI/CD Pipeline Test

This file tests the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline including:

## âœ… Workflows Being Tested

### 1. Never Break Main Pipeline
- Quick validation (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, unit tests)
- Full stack testing with Docker services
- Security and dependency scanning
- Build validation and Docker container builds
- Main branch protection gate

### 2. Claude Code Integration
- Automated PR review on pull request creation
- @claude mention responses in comments
- Agent-driven automation workflows
- Documentation sync automation

### 3. Branch Protection Rules
- PR requirements validation
- Conventional commit format checking
- Branch naming convention enforcement
- Required status checks

## ðŸ§ª Test Cases

### Test 1: Basic Pipeline
This PR should trigger all the basic validation checks:
- âœ… TypeScript compilation
- âœ… ESLint code quality
- âœ… Prettier formatting
- âœ… Unit tests

### Test 2: Infrastructure Testing
The pipeline should:
- âœ… Start Docker services (ClickHouse, MinIO, OTel Collector)
- âœ… Run database migrations
- âœ… Execute integration tests
- âœ… Run E2E tests with Playwright
- âœ… Validate OpenTelemetry demo integration
- âœ… Clean up services

### Test 3: Security Scanning
- âœ… Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- âœ… Scan for secrets in code
- âœ… Check for outdated dependencies

### Test 4: Build Validation
- âœ… Generate protobuf definitions
- âœ… Build application successfully
- âœ… Validate Docker builds
- âœ… Test production deployment

### Test 5: Claude Code Integration
- When this PR is created, Claude should automatically review it
- Comments with @claude should trigger Claude responses
- Agent workflows should be available for automation

## ðŸ“‹ Expected Behavior

1. **Immediate**: Quick validation should run and pass
2. **Full Pipeline**: All comprehensive tests should execute
3. **Claude Review**: Automated code review should be posted
4. **Protection**: PR should be blocked if any checks fail
5. **Success**: All green checks should allow merge to main

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows execute successfully
- [ ] No red X marks on any required checks
- [ ] Claude Code provides automated review
- [ ] PR meets all requirements (title, branch name, description)
- [ ] Ready to merge with confidence that main branch is protected

This test validates our "Never Break Main" philosophy with comprehensive automation!
