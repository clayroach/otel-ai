# Day 12: Cedar Plank Salmon and Life Reflections

**The Plan**: Continue intensive AI analyzer development and UI integration  
**The Reality**: "Sometimes the best code insights come when you're grilling fresh salmon on cedar planks"

Welcome to Day 12 of building an AI-native observability platform in 30 days. Today I did something that might seem counterproductive in a time-constrained challenge: I went fishing again. But as I'm learning, stepping away from the keyboard often provides the clarity that hours of focused coding cannot.

## üé£ Chasing Coho and Chinook

After targeting pink salmon recently, we decided to shift our focus to coho and chinook - larger, more challenging fish that require different techniques and patience. The day yielded a single beautiful coho, but what a reward it was.

There's something deeply satisfying about the entire process: the patient casting, reading the water, the fight when you finally hook something substantial, and then the ritual of preparing your catch. We grilled that coho on cedar planks with just salt, pepper, and lemon zest - sometimes the simplest preparations let the quality of your work speak for itself.

## üéôÔ∏è DHH and the Work-Life Philosophy

During some of my now daily runs here in West Seattle, I found myself listening to David Heinemeier Hansson on the Lex Fridman podcast ([DHH on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dhh)). While I don't align with all of his perspectives, several points resonated deeply, particularly his advocacy for 4-hour or 8-hour maximum workdays.

DHH's core argument isn't just about productivity - it's about what happens to the rest of your life when work consumes everything. He talks about finding joy in family, in hobbies, in being a complete human being rather than just an optimization machine for code output.

This hit home as I'm 12 days into a 30-day intensive development challenge while also being a father to three children.

## üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ The Unexpected Joy of Parenthood

One of the most profound reflections from today was about my own growth since becoming a parent. My wife Aneke brought three children into my life - each one unique, challenging, and more joy-filled than I ever imagined possible.

Becoming a parent to children who weren't originally "mine" has taught me about unconditional love in ways I never expected. Each child presents their own challenges:

- Learning different communication styles and what motivates each one
- Adapting to personalities and needs that developed before I was in their lives
- Building trust and relationships from a foundation of respect rather than biology
- Finding ways to be present and engaged despite demanding professional goals

But the joy they bring? It's transformative. Their excitement about the joys in their own lives as they move through different stages. Their openness and willingness to tell us anything (and that means ANYTHING), going on with their moods, friends, experiences (good and bad), or just being able to be silent together. Their reminder that there's a whole world beyond code and terminals and deployment pipelines.

## ‚öñÔ∏è The Balance Challenge

The 30-day development challenge creates an interesting tension with family priorities. On one hand, the 4-hour intensive development approach leaves plenty of time for family. On the other hand, the mental energy required for this kind of deep technical work doesn't just turn off when you close the laptop.

Today's fishing trip wasn't just about catching salmon - it was about consciously choosing to be present for experiences outside of work. Aneke appreciated having cedar-plank grilled coho for dinner after a long day of doula care for a birthing mother. These moments matter more than any deployment pipeline or AI model optimization.

## üçΩÔ∏è The Cedar Plank Metaphor

Grilling salmon on cedar planks requires patience, preparation, and trust in the process. You can't rush it. You can't constantly check and adjust. You prepare well, apply the fundamentals, and then let the combination of time, heat, and natural flavors do their work.

Software development - especially ambitious projects - requires similar trust in the process. You build solid foundations, apply proven patterns, and then allow the compound benefits of good decisions to emerge over time.

## üöÄ Tomorrow's Re-engagement

Taking today off doesn't slow down the project - it fuels it. Tomorrow I'll return to the AI analyzer integration work with:

- Fresh perspective on user experience priorities
- Renewed enthusiasm for the technical challenges
- Clear understanding of why this work matters (building something meaningful while maintaining family priorities)
- Specific insights about model selection improvements that occurred while not actively thinking about them

## üí° Lessons for Fellow Developers

If you're grinding through an intense project:

### Take the fishing day
Your code will be better for it. Your family will appreciate it. Your creativity will thank you.

### Listen to your priorities
If family matters to you, structure your work to support family time, not compete with it. The 4-hour intensive development approach isn't just a productivity hack - it's a life philosophy.

### Trust the process
Good software, like cedar-plank salmon, can't be rushed. Prepare well, apply fundamentals, and allow quality to emerge through time and patience.

### Measure joy, not just commits
The best projects bring satisfaction both in the building and in the life that surrounds the building. If your work is consuming everything else you care about, it's time to restructure, not work harder.

## üîÆ The Bigger Picture

We're building an AI-native observability platform not just as a technical demonstration, but as proof that thoughtful development practices can achieve remarkable results while honoring the relationships and experiences that make life meaningful.

The cedar-plank coho was perfect. The time with family was irreplaceable. The project gained clarity and focus. This is what sustainable development looks like.

Tomorrow: returning to AI analyzer integration work with fresh perspective, renewed energy, and cedar-plank salmon still on the grill.
