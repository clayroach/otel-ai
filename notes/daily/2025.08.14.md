## 📊 End of Day Progress Review

### ✅ Completed Goals








### 💡 Key Insights & Learnings
- 💡 Needed more capacity with Claude to do more than 3-4 hours in a day

### 🚧 Challenges & Blockers
- ⚠️ Alignment between the docker compose version and the runtime for ingesting OTLP data.  These need to be reconciled.

### 🔧 Technical Highlights
- 🔧 docker compose was finished, as was typescript build and initial source code and tests.  All on track.

### 📈 Day 2 Summary
- Progress: 6% complete of 30-day challenge
- Overall momentum: [Add your assessment: Strong/Good/Moderate/Slow]
- Tomorrow's priority: [Add what should be the top focus]

## 📊 End of Day Progress Review [08:59]

### ✅ Completed Goals
- ✅ Define project vision and inception goals
- ✅ Create comprehensive package architecture with Effect-TS integration

### 🔄 Partially Complete
- 🔄 Set up documentation-driven development workflow (75% complete - remaining: Fix remaining Effect-TS type issues in config package)

### ❌ Not Started
- ❌ Create CLAUDE.md for future Claude Code sessions (reason: Focused on TestContainers integration instead)

### 🎉 Unexpected Accomplishments
- 🎉 Fixed all Effect-TS compilation issues blocking storage package
- 🎉 Created comprehensive TestContainers integration with ClickHouse and MinIO
- 🎉 Established two-tier testing strategy (unit + integration tests)

### 💡 Key Insights & Learnings
- 💡 TestContainers provides deterministic testing environments with real databases
- 💡 Effect-TS readonly array issues can be resolved by disabling exactOptionalPropertyTypes
- 💡 Two-tier testing (fast unit + thorough integration) provides best of both worlds

### 🚧 Challenges & Blockers
- ⚠️ S3 server-side encryption incompatible with MinIO in tests
- ⚠️ ClickHouse timestamp formatting required nanosecond to second conversion
- ⚠️ Git merge conflicts from simultaneous main branch updates

### 🔧 Technical Highlights
- 🔧 Implemented TestContainers integration for storage layer
- 🔧 Created 12 integration tests with real ClickHouse and MinIO containers
- 🔧 Fixed Effect-TS compilation errors in storage package
- 🔧 Added configurable S3 encryption for MinIO compatibility
- 🔧 Established vitest.integration.config.ts with 5-minute timeouts

### 📈 Day 2 Summary
- Progress: 6% complete of 30-day challenge
- Overall momentum: Strong
- Tomorrow's priority: Continue with AI analyzer package implementation
