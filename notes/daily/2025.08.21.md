# Day 9 - Starting LLM Manager Implementation

## ðŸ“… Timeline Correction

- **Day 7**: August 19 (resumed after fishing break)
- **Day 8**: August 20 (modular design & UI enhancements - completed yesterday)
- **Day 9**: August 21 (today - starting LLM Manager implementation)

## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Goals

### Primary Objectives

- [ ] Begin LLM Manager package implementation using established modular patterns
- [ ] Define clear interfaces for GPT, Claude, and local Llama integration
- [ ] Implement context optimization for different model capabilities
- [ ] Set up comprehensive testing strategy with model mocking
- [ ] Document LLM Manager package following established patterns

### Context from Yesterday (Day 8)

Yesterday's major achievement was establishing **modular design principles for AI/LLM development**:

- âœ… Added encoding type UI visibility with visual indicators
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive JSON OTLP integration testing
- âœ… Created interface-first development patterns
- âœ… Enhanced start-day-agent with package documentation review
- âœ… Synchronized all documentation with current implementation

## ðŸš€ Today's Focus: LLM Manager Package

With the modular foundation established, today we begin implementing the **LLM Manager package** - the foundation that enables all AI features in the platform.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Interface Definition**: Define LLM Manager service interfaces following Effect-TS patterns
2. **Multi-Model Support**: Implement adapters for different LLM providers
3. **Context Management**: Smart context optimization for model capabilities
4. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing with mocking and real API integration
5. **Documentation**: Complete package documentation following established patterns

### Expected Outcomes

- LLM Manager package with clear, testable interfaces
- Multi-model support (GPT, Claude, local models)
- Foundation ready for AI Analyzer and UI Generator packages
- Maintained development velocity using modular patterns
