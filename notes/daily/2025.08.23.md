# Day 11 - Protobuf Fixes Merged, Return to Analytics

## üìä Yesterday's Progress Review

### ‚úÖ Completed Goals
- [x] Enhanced protobuf attribute extraction with recursive `extractProtobufValue` function
- [x] Fixed UI status column width overflow with shortened status labels
- [x] All 91 core tests passing
- [x] Created comprehensive PR #24 with organized screenshots
- [x] PR merged to main branch successfully

### üîÑ Partially Complete
- [ ] Holistic BigInt analysis deferred to architectural review

### üöß Technical Achievements
- Fixed BigInt serialization issues in @bufbuild/protobuf format
- Enhanced attribute cleaning with `cleanAttributes` helper 
- Handles protobuf objects with `$typeName` and case-based value extraction
- UI status codes now display as UNSET/OK/ERROR instead of long OpenTelemetry codes
- Maintains full OpenTelemetry semantic compliance in backend

## üéØ Current Priority Todos

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Merge protobuf fixes to main branch
- [ ] Return to analytics work with protobuf fixes merged
- [ ] Continue analytics implementation using fixed protobuf parsing

### Deferred to Later Architectural Review
- [ ] Deep dive into BigInt handling in JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
- [ ] Analyze why @bufbuild/protobuf generates BigInt for integers instead of numbers
- [ ] Research best practices for BigInt serialization in Node.js applications
- [ ] Consider alternative protobuf libraries if BigInt issues persist
- [ ] Document BigInt handling strategy in technical notes (ADR)

## üîç Technical Context

**Protobuf Issue Resolution**: 
- Root cause: @bufbuild/protobuf returns nested objects with `$typeName` and case-based values (`{case: 'stringValue', value: 'actual_value'}`)
- Solution: Recursive extraction function that handles all protobuf value types
- Impact: Fixed attribute extraction preventing proper telemetry data processing

**UI Improvement**:
- Status column width issue resolved by displaying shortened labels while preserving full semantic values
- Hover tooltips show full OpenTelemetry status codes for debugging

## üöÄ Next Steps

**Primary Focus**: Return to analytics work now that protobuf parsing is reliable
- Leverage fixed protobuf extraction for accurate analytics processing
- Continue implementation with confidence in data quality

### Expected Outcomes
- Analytics features can now properly process both JSON and protobuf OTLP data
- Foundation for AI-powered anomaly detection with clean telemetry data
- Reliable basis for dashboard generation and insights

## üì¶ Packages Affected Today

- [x] Update package notes for:
  - Package: [[packages.storage]] - Enhanced protobuf attribute extraction
  - Package: [[packages.ui]] - Status column display improvements
  - Package: [[packages.server]] - OTLP ingestion reliability

## üí° Key Learnings

### Protobuf Parsing Complexity
- @bufbuild/protobuf uses complex nested object structures for type safety
- Recursive extraction required for deep attribute cleaning
- BigInt handling needs broader architectural consideration

### UI/Backend Separation
- UI display formatting should be separate from backend semantic storage
- Tooltip approach provides both usability and debugging capability
- Shortened labels improve column layout without losing information

## üîÆ Tomorrow's Plan

**Priority Focus**: Analytics Implementation
- [ ] Resume analytics work with reliable protobuf parsing
- [ ] Implement AI-powered anomaly detection features
- [ ] Begin dashboard generation capabilities

### Process Improvement Target
- Document protobuf parsing strategy for future reference
- Consider ADR for BigInt handling architectural decision
