- **New Infrastructure**: `config/` directory, `src/test/test-environment.ts`
- **Open PR**: #47 fixing test command hanging issues

## Today's Planned Cleanup Priorities (Original Plan)

### **Priority 1: Screenshot Organization**
**Goal**: Complete visual documentation and screenshot workflow

- Resume previous screenshot organization work
- Implement organized screenshot storage and retrieval
- Ensure visual documentation supports AI features phase
- Clean up screenshot management patterns

### **Priority 2: UI Consolidation into src/ Directory**
**Goal**: Organize UI components under unified src/ structure

- Move UI components into proper src/ directory hierarchy
- Follow established package structure patterns
- Ensure UI code follows Effect-TS patterns
- Consolidate scattered UI files into cohesive structure

### **Priority 3: Effect-Only Implementation (Time-boxed)**
**Goal**: Remove Promise usage and move to pure Effect-TS patterns

- **Time Box**: Set specific time limit for this refactoring
- Identify all Promise usage across codebase
- Convert Promise patterns to Effect-TS equivalents
- Ensure consistent error handling and resource management
- Test all conversions thoroughly

## üîÑ Day End Summary

### **Completed Work**

- ‚úÖ **Screenshot Manager**: Core service implemented with Cloudinary integration
- ‚úÖ **Daily Planning**: Context engineering approach documented
- ‚úÖ **Strategic Documentation**: Guerrilla marketing strategy added
- ‚úÖ **Core Upload Functionality**: Real Cloudinary uploads working

### **Deferred Work** (moved to Day 18)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blog Banner Generation**: Too complex with Cloudinary - needs simpler approach
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UI Consolidation**: Deferred to focus on core visualization work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Effect-TS Migration**: Time-boxed, moved to next day

### **Critical Pivot Decision**

**Reason**: Focus must shift to core differentiator - dynamic UI visualization generation

**Impact**: If we can't dynamically generate visualizations from AI analysis, the project fails its core promise

**Next Steps**: Day 18 design spike on dynamic chart generation

   - Test consolidated structure
   
2. **Promise ‚Üí Effect Conversion** (1 hour - TIME BOXED)
   - Identify Promise usage patterns
   - Convert highest-impact Promise patterns
   - Stop at time limit - document remaining work

## Technical Context

- **Organized UI**: All UI components under src/ hierarchy
- **Visual Documentation**: Screenshot workflows supporting development
- **Clean Foundation**: Ready for advanced AI feature development

## Key Insights & Strategy

### **Context Engineering: The New Programming Paradigm**

**Core Observation**: The future of AI-assisted development centers on **context engineering** - programming towards building agents (prompts + tools) that are engineered with the smallest possible context windows and sizes needed to execute.

**Engineering Approach Evolution:**
- **Traditional**: Large monolithic functions with extensive context dependencies
- **AI-Native**: Minimal context agents with focused, specific responsibilities
- **Goal**: Each agent understands exactly what it needs, nothing more

**Context Engineering Principles:**
1. **Minimal Context Windows**: Design agents to operate with smallest possible context
2. **Focused Responsibilities**: Each agent has one clear, specific purpose  
3. **Self-Contained Operations**: Agents include all context they need internally
4. **Clean Interfaces**: Minimal dependencies between agents
5. **Documentation-Driven**: Context requirements clearly specified upfront

**Impact on Development:**
- **Faster Iteration**: Agents work independently without full system context
- **Better Reliability**: Focused agents less prone to context confusion
- **Easier Maintenance**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Agents can be developed and tested in isolation

This represents a fundamental shift from traditional software architecture toward **agent-oriented programming** optimized for AI assistance.

**Industry Validation**: This aligns with LangChain's observation on "The Rise of Context Engineering" ([blog.langchain.com/the-rise-of-context-engineering/](https://blog.langchain.com/the-rise-of-context-engineering/)), confirming that context engineering is becoming a recognized discipline in AI-assisted development.

### **Why These Cleanup Tasks Matter**
1. **Screenshot Organization**: Visual documentation critical for AI features UI
2. **UI Consolidation**: Clean structure enables rapid UI component generation  
3. **Effect-Only Pattern**: Consistent error handling and resource management
4. **Foundation Quality**: Clean codebase enables confident AI feature development

### **Time-Boxing Philosophy**
- **Screenshot & UI**: Complete thoroughly (foundational for AI phase)
- **Promise Conversion**: Time-boxed attempt (can continue later if needed)
- **Quality Over Perfection**: Ready foundation over perfect refactoring

## Tomorrow's Transition (Day 18)

**Theme**: Advanced AI Features Development Begins
- **Focus**: Real-time anomaly detection with autoencoder patterns
- **Foundation**: Clean, Effect-TS codebase with organized UI structure
- **Visual Tools**: Screenshot workflows supporting development
- **Confidence**: Solid infrastructure enabling rapid AI feature iteration

## Notes & Discoveries
