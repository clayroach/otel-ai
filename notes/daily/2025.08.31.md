# Day 19 - August 31, 2025

## Today's Highlights

Beautiful day at Alki beach with friends. Enjoyed some excellent crab and salmon fishing followed by a great BBQ. Sometimes the best development days are the ones where you step away from the code and recharge with good company and great food.

## Personal Notes

- Perfect weather for beach activities
- Successful fishing trip - fresh crab and salmon
- Quality time with friends over BBQ
- Mental reset before diving back into the project

## Tomorrow's Focus

Ready to get back to the UI visualization work with fresh perspective.
