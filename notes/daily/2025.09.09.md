3. **Tests Passing**: All critical test suites green
4. **Demo Ready**: At least one compelling demo scenario functional

### Definition of "Done" for 30-Day Challenge

#### Minimum Viable Success (Core Requirements)
- ✅ **Data Ingestion**: OTLP → ClickHouse pipeline working
- ✅ **AI Analysis**: Anomaly detection and pattern recognition functional
- ✅ **LLM Integration**: Multi-model orchestration operational
- 🔄 **Dynamic UI**: LLM-generated dashboards rendering
- 🔄 **End-to-End Demo**: Complete workflow demonstration
- 🔄 **Blog Documentation**: 30-day journey documented

#### Stretch Goals (If Time Permits)
