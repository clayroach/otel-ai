# ADR-001: 4-Hour Workday Philosophy and Project Approach

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The traditional software development approach assumes 8-hour workdays and month-long timelines. However, with AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code, we can fundamentally rethink how much human time should be required for complex software projects.

## Decision
We are adopting a **4-hour workday standard** for this project, with the following principles:

### Core Philosophy
- **Automation Over Hours**: Computers should handle repetitive tasks, freeing humans for creative and strategic work
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focused 4-hour sessions produce better results than distracted 8-hour days
- **Life-Work Balance**: Technology should give us more time with family and for living, not consume it
- **Measurement by Hours, Not Days**: The "30-day challenge" tracks focused development hours, not calendar days

### Implementation Strategy
- **Maximum 4 hours of focused development per session**
- **AI-first approach**: Use Claude Code, Copilot, and other AI tools for routine tasks
- **Documentation-driven development**: Write specifications first, let AI generate implementation
- **Automated workflows**: Scripts and agents handle repetitive operations

### Success Metrics
- **Hours spent vs. features delivered** (not days elapsed)
- **Automation adoption rate** (what % of tasks are AI-assisted)
- **Quality metrics** (test coverage, type safety, documentation completeness)
- **Developer satisfaction** (time for life outside work)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Demonstrates that AI can compress traditional development timelines
- Shows technology serving human wellbeing rather than consuming it
- Creates a sustainable development practice
- Produces higher quality work through focused sessions

### Risks to Mitigate
- Need clear boundaries to prevent "scope creep" beyond 4 hours
- Requires excellent time tracking and goal setting
- Must maintain project momentum with shorter sessions

## Implementation
- Track all development time in daily notes
- Use start-day and end-day agents for focused goal setting
- Automate as much infrastructure and routine work as possible
- Measure success by features delivered per hour, not total time spent
