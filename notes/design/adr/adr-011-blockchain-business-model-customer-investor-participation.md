# ADR-011: Blockchain-Based Business Model with Customer-Investor Participation

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The traditional SaaS model limits customer engagement to subscription payments, missing opportunities for deeper stakeholder alignment and community-driven growth. Meanwhile, the blockchain tokenization market is experiencing explosive growth, projected to expand from $3.38 billion in 2024 to $393.45 billion by 2030 (CAGR of 64.2%).

Recent success stories demonstrate the viability of revenue-sharing tokens: Bananagun (218% returns in 2024), Aerodrome (13x growth), and Raydium (289% returns) all use revenue-sharing models that align user interests with platform success. This creates a compelling opportunity to combine traditional SaaS revenue with blockchain-based customer-investor participation.

## Decision

Implement a **dual-revenue blockchain business model** that allows customers to participate as stakeholders through "OTEL Shares" - blockchain tokens that represent both usage credits and revenue-sharing participation in the platform's success.

## Business Model Architecture

### Dual Payment System

#### Traditional SaaS Revenue Stream
```typescript
interface TraditionalSaaSPricing {
  tiers: {
    starter: {
      monthlyUSD: 29
      features: ['Basic observability', '10GB storage', 'Email support']
      limits: { traces: 100000, users: 5 }
    }
    professional: {
      monthlyUSD: 199  
      features: ['Advanced AI insights', '100GB storage', 'Slack integration', 'Priority support']
      limits: { traces: 1000000, users: 25 }
    }
    enterprise: {
      monthlyUSD: 999
      features: ['Custom AI models', 'Unlimited storage', 'Dedicated support', 'On-premise options']
      limits: { traces: 'unlimited', users: 'unlimited' }
    }
  }
  
  // Traditional payment methods
  acceptedPayments: ['credit-card', 'bank-transfer', 'invoice']
  billingCycles: ['monthly', 'annual']
  discounts: { annual: 20, enterprise: 'negotiable' }
}
```

#### OTEL Shares Token Economy
```typescript
interface OTELSharesTokenEconomy {
  token: {
    name: 'OTEL Shares'
    symbol: 'OTEL'
    blockchain: 'Ethereum' | 'Polygon'  // Lower gas fees on Polygon
    tokenType: 'ERC-20'
    totalSupply: 100_000_000  // 100M tokens
  }
  
  distribution: {
    customerInvestors: 60_000_000   // 60% - Customer-investors
    foundingTeam: 15_000_000        // 15% - Founding team (vested)
    advisors: 5_000_000             // 5% - Advisors and early supporters
    treasury: 10_000_000            // 10% - Platform development
    liquidityPool: 10_000_000       // 10% - DEX liquidity
  }
  
  utilityFunctions: {
    serviceCredits: 'Pay for platform usage'
    revenueSharing: 'Receive quarterly revenue distributions'
    governance: 'Vote on platform features and priorities'
    stakingRewards: 'Earn additional tokens through staking'
    premiumAccess: 'Access to advanced features and beta releases'
  }
}
```

### Revenue-Sharing Mechanism

#### Quarterly Revenue Distribution Model
```typescript
interface RevenueDistributionModel {
  distributionSchedule: 'quarterly'  // Every 3 months
  revenuePercentage: 25  // 25% of net revenue distributed to token holders
  
  revenueStreams: {
    traditionalSaaS: 'Monthly/annual subscription revenue'
    enterpriseContracts: 'Custom enterprise deployment revenue'
    apiUsage: 'Pay-per-use API access revenue'
    dataInsights: 'Premium AI insights and custom reports'
    professionalServices: 'Consulting and implementation services'
  }
  
  distributionFormula: {
    netRevenue: 'totalRevenue - operatingExpenses - taxes'
    distributableAmount: 'netRevenue * 0.25'  // 25% to token holders
    perTokenValue: 'distributableAmount / circulatingSupply'
    userDistribution: 'userTokenBalance * perTokenValue'
  }
}

export class RevenueDistributionEngine {
  async calculateQuarterlyDistribution(): Promise<QuarterlyDistribution> {
    const quarterlyMetrics = await this.getQuarterlyFinancials()
    const circulatingSupply = await this.getCirculatingTokenSupply()
    
    const distribution = {
      quarter: this.getCurrentQuarter(),
      totalRevenue: quarterlyMetrics.totalRevenue,
      netRevenue: quarterlyMetrics.netRevenue,
      distributableAmount: quarterlyMetrics.netRevenue * 0.25,
      perTokenValue: (quarterlyMetrics.netRevenue * 0.25) / circulatingSupply,
      totalTokenHolders: await this.getTokenHolderCount(),
      averageDistribution: this.calculateAverageDistribution(quarterlyMetrics, circulatingSupply)
    }
    
    return distribution
  }

  async executeDistribution(distribution: QuarterlyDistribution): Promise<DistributionResult> {
    // Smart contract execution for automated distribution
    const distributionContract = await this.getDistributionContract()
    
    const result = await distributionContract.distributeRevenue({
      totalAmount: distribution.distributableAmount,
      perTokenValue: distribution.perTokenValue,
      quarter: distribution.quarter
    })
    
    // Notify all token holders
    await this.notifyTokenHolders(distribution, result)
    
    return result
  }
}
```

### Token Purchase and Utility Integration

#### Customer-Investor Onboarding Flow
```typescript
export class CustomerInvestorOnboarding {
  async onboardCustomerInvestor(customer: Customer): Promise<OnboardingResult> {
    const onboardingOptions = {
      traditionalOnly: {
        description: 'Standard SaaS subscription with USD payments',
        benefits: ['Platform access', 'Support', 'Standard features']
      },
      
      hybridInvestor: {
        description: 'Partial OTEL Shares purchase + reduced USD subscription',
        benefits: ['Platform access', 'Revenue sharing', 'Governance voting', 'Premium features'],
        example: {
          normalCost: 199,  // Professional tier
          tokenPurchase: 1000,  // 1000 OTEL tokens at $0.10 = $100
          reducedSubscription: 99,  // 50% discount on subscription
          totalFirstMonth: 199,  // Same cost, but now they're investors
          futureMonths: 99,  // Ongoing reduced subscription
          revenueSharing: 'Quarterly distributions based on token holdings'
        }
      },
      
      fullInvestor: {
        description: 'Full service payment through OTEL Shares',
        benefits: ['Platform access', 'Maximum revenue sharing', 'Full governance rights', 'All premium features'],
        example: {
          tokenPurchase: 2000,  // 2000 OTEL tokens at $0.10 = $200
          monthlySubscription: 0,  // Tokens cover service usage
          revenueSharing: 'Maximum quarterly distributions',
          stakingRewards: 'Additional OTEL rewards for long-term holding'
        }
      }
    }
    
    return this.presentOnboardingOptions(customer, onboardingOptions)
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Blockchain Infrastructure

#### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
// OTEL Shares Token Contract (ERC-20 with additional utilities)
contract OTELShares is ERC20, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    struct RevenueDistribution {
        uint256 quarter;

        }
        
        return totalRewards;
    }
}
```

#### Integration with Platform Services
```typescript
export class BlockchainPaymentProcessor {
  private otelContract: Contract
  private paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor
  
  async processPayment(customer: Customer, service: ServiceTier): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    const paymentOptions = await this.getPaymentOptions(customer, service)
    
    if (paymentOptions.preferredMethod === 'otel-tokens') {
      return await this.processTokenPayment(customer, service)
    } else if (paymentOptions.preferredMethod === 'hybrid') {
      return await this.processHybridPayment(customer, service)
    } else {
      return await this.processTraditionalPayment(customer, service)
    }
  }
  
  private async processTokenPayment(customer: Customer, service: ServiceTier): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    const tokenCost = await this.calculateTokenCost(service)
    const customerBalance = await this.getCustomerTokenBalance(customer)
    
    if (customerBalance >= tokenCost) {
      // Deduct tokens and activate service
      await this.deductTokens(customer, tokenCost)
      await this.activateService(customer, service)
      
      return {
        success: true,
        method: 'otel-tokens',
        amount: tokenCost,
        revenueShare: true,  // Token holders receive revenue sharing benefits
        governanceRights: true
      }
    } else {
      return { success: false, reason: 'insufficient-tokens' }
    }
  }
}
```
