# ADR-014: LLM Management Library Evaluation and Hardcoded Model Reference Refactoring

## Status
‚úÖ Implemented (September 15, 2025)

## Context

The custom LLM Manager in `clayroach/otel-ai` has revealed significant complexity and architectural issues during implementation:

### Current Architecture Problems
1. **Hardcoded Model References**: Throughout the codebase, we use hardcoded string literals `'gpt'`, `'claude'`, `'llama'` instead of actual model names
2. **Complex Custom Routing**: Manual model selection logic with custom error handling and fallback strategies
3. **Configuration Duplication**: Multiple environment variable loading functions (`config.ts`, `llm-manager-live.ts`) with inconsistent behavior
4. **Client Management Overhead**: Manual client instantiation, health checking, and performance tracking
5. **Testing Complexity**: Extensive mocking required for multi-model scenarios
6. **Runtime vs Test Environment Divergence**: Tests pass but UI still shows fallback queries instead of LLM-generated ones

### Key Architectural Insight
Building our own LLM management layer doesn't make sense when specialized libraries exist that provide battle-tested solutions for multi-model orchestration, routing, and resilience.

## Decision

**Phase 1**: Refactor to eliminate hardcoded model references and fix immediate runtime issues
**Phase 2**: Evaluate and implement a specialized LLM management library to replace custom implementation

## Performance Assessment and Model Selection

Based on comprehensive testing conducted January 2025, we evaluated performance across multiple models for diagnostic SQL generation tasks. This data provides crucial input for library evaluation and model selection decisions.

### Multi-Model Performance Benchmarks

**Test Configuration:**
- Task: Diagnostic SQL query generation for observability data
- Environment: Local LM Studio + API models
- Measurement: Response time, query quality, diagnostic feature completeness

**Performance Results (January 2025):**

| Model | Duration | Quality | Cost | Diagnostic Features | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|---------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **GPT-3.5-turbo** | **6.5s** ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | Excellent | API Cost | Error analysis, CTEs, health scoring | **Speed-critical use cases** |
| **CodeLlama-7b** | **10.6s** ‚ö°‚ö° | Very Good | Free | Full diagnostic features | **Primary local model** üèÜ |
| **SQLCoder-7b-2** | **19.4s** ‚ö° | Good | Free | Basic diagnostic features | **Fallback option** |
| **Claude-3-7 Sonnet** | **25.5s** üêå | Excellent | High API Cost | Most sophisticated CTEs | **Quality-critical tasks** |
| **Qwen3-Coder-30b** | **28.2s** üêåüêå | Good | Free | Full diagnostic features | **Not recommended** |

**Key Findings:**

1. **CodeLlama-7b-instruct** provides the optimal **speed/quality/cost balance** for local deployment
2. **2x faster than SQLCoder** while generating significantly better diagnostic queries  
3. **GPT-3.5-turbo** offers exceptional speed (6x faster) but incurs API costs
4. All models now generate **valid SQL** with diagnostic features after prompt improvements
5. **Local models** (CodeLlama, SQLCoder) eliminate API dependencies and costs

**Quality Assessment Details:**
- **Diagnostic Features**: Error analysis, volume context, health scoring, real-time focus
- **SQL Structure**: CTE usage, proper trace filtering, bottleneck detection
- **Validation**: All models pass strict diagnostic query validation

### Model Selection Impact on Library Choice

This performance data significantly influences our library evaluation:

**For Local-First Strategy (Recommended):**
- **CodeLlama-7b-instruct** as primary model provides excellent performance without API dependencies
- Reduces complexity of multi-provider management
- Eliminates external service risks and costs

**For Hybrid Strategy:**
- **CodeLlama** for development/testing (fast, free)
- **GPT-3.5-turbo** for production speed-critical paths
- **Claude-3-7 Sonnet** for complex diagnostic scenarios

## Library Evaluation

Based on comprehensive research and performance testing, we evaluated four primary options:

### 1. LangChain.js - Multi-Model Prompt Routing and Tool Selection

## Recommended Solution

**Updated Strategy Based on Performance Data: Local-First with Selective API Integration**

Given our performance benchmarks showing **CodeLlama-7b-instruct** provides excellent quality at 10.6s response time with zero API costs, we recommend a **local-first approach** with strategic API integration:

### Phase 1: Hardcoded Reference Elimination (Immediate)
Address the fundamental architectural issue causing runtime failures:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Hardcoded model types
const client = model === 'gpt' ? clients.gpt : clients.claude : clients.llama

// AFTER: Actual model name routing
if (model.includes('claude')) {
  client = clients.claude
} else if (model.includes('gpt')) {
  client = clients.gpt
} else {
  // Local models (sqlcoder-7b-2, codellama-7b-instruct, etc.)
  client = clients.llama
}
```

**Tasks:**
1. Remove all hardcoded `'gpt'`, `'claude'`, `'llama'` references across codebase (27+ files)
2. Update router `isModelAvailable()` and client selection to use actual model names
3. Consolidate environment variable loading into single source of truth
4. Fix UI runtime routing to use actual models instead of fallback queries

### Phase 2: Portkey Integration (Strategic)
Replace custom LLM Manager with Portkey for production-grade orchestration:

```yaml
# portkey-config.yaml
targets:
  - name: "sql-models"
    models: ["sqlcoder-7b-2", "codellama-7b-instruct"]
    strategy: "loadbalance"
    
  - name: "general-models" 
    models: ["claude-3-haiku-20240307", "gpt-3.5-turbo"]
    strategy: "fallback"

routes:
  - condition: "prompt.contains('SELECT') || prompt.contains('SQL')"
    target: "sql-models"
  - condition: "default"
    target: "general-models"
```

**Updated Configuration Strategy Based on Performance Data:**

```yaml
# Optimized configuration prioritizing CodeLlama for cost-effectiveness
targets:
  - name: "local-primary"
    models: ["codellama-7b-instruct"]  # Primary: Best speed/quality/cost balance
    strategy: "single"
    
  - name: "local-fallback" 
    models: ["sqlcoder-7b-2"]         # Fallback: Reliable but slower
    strategy: "single"
    
  - name: "api-speed"
    models: ["gpt-3.5-turbo"]         # Speed-critical: 6x faster than local
    strategy: "single"
    
  - name: "api-quality"
    models: ["claude-3-haiku-20240307"]  # Complex scenarios only
    strategy: "single"

routes:
  - condition: "prompt.contains('CRITICAL') || response_time_required < 7000"
    target: "api-speed"               # Use GPT for speed-critical tasks
  - condition: "prompt.contains('complex') || prompt.contains('sophisticated')"
    target: "api-quality"             # Use Claude for complex diagnostics
  - condition: "development || cost_optimization_enabled"
    target: "local-primary"           # Default to CodeLlama for cost efficiency
  - condition: "local_primary_unavailable"
    target: "local-fallback"          # SQLCoder as backup
```

**Why This Strategy?**
1. **Cost Optimization**: CodeLlama as primary (free) with API models for specific needs
2. **Performance Balance**: 10.6s response time acceptable for most diagnostic queries
3. **Quality Assurance**: All models now generate valid diagnostic SQL
4. **Flexibility**: Easy switching to faster API models when speed is critical
5. **Reliability**: Local models eliminate external dependencies

## Rate Limiting Analysis and Client-Side Retry Decision (September 2025)

### Problem Discovery
During integration testing with parallel execution, we discovered that Portkey's gateway has a hardcoded 60-second `MAX_RETRY_LIMIT_MS` limitation. When Anthropic returns retry-after headers of ~196 seconds (common for workspace rate limits), Portkey recognizes it should retry (`x-should-retry: true`) but skips the retry because the delay exceeds its internal limit.

### Comprehensive Provider Analysis

We evaluated multiple LLM gateway/proxy providers to understand their retry capabilities:

#### Provider Comparison Matrix

| Provider | Max Retry Delay | Respects Retry-After | Implementation Complexity | Verdict |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| **Portkey** | 60 seconds | Partially | Low | ‚ùå Insufficient for long delays |
| **LiteLLM** | Unlimited | Yes | Medium | ‚úÖ Full exponential backoff |
| **Helicone** | Unlimited | Yes | Low | ‚úÖ Simple header-based retry |
| **Kong AI Gateway** | Unlimited | Yes | High | ‚úÖ Enterprise-grade but complex |
| **OpenRouter** | N/A | No built-in | N/A | ‚ùå Requires client implementation |
| **LangChain** | Unlimited | Yes | Medium | ‚úÖ Framework-level retry |
| **n8n** | Unlimited | Yes | Low | ‚úÖ Workflow automation |

#### Key Findings

1. **LiteLLM**: Provides full exponential backoff for RateLimitError with configurable `num_retries`. Supports router-based load balancing and fallback to different model groups. Redis integration for distributed TPM/RPM tracking.

2. **Helicone**: Simple header-based retry enabling (`Helicone-Retry-Enabled: true`) with automatic exponential backoff. Open source with active development and good observability features.

3. **Kong AI Gateway**: Enterprise-grade AI Rate Limiting Advanced plugin with token-based cost calculation, provider-specific limits, and jitter support. Returns proper 429 with Retry-After headers.

4. **OpenRouter**: Relies on client-side implementation. Returns standard rate limit headers but no built-in retry mechanism.

### Decision: Client-Side Retry with Portkey

After thorough analysis, we decided to **implement client-side retry logic while keeping Portkey** for the following reasons:

1. **Minimal Disruption**: Our Portkey configuration is already working well for routing, caching, and model selection
2. **Quick Implementation**: Client-side retry can be added in hours vs. days/weeks for migration
3. **Full Control**: We can handle any retry-after delay, not limited by gateway constraints
4. **Future Flexibility**: If Portkey updates their retry limit, we can easily disable client-side retry
5. **Best of Both Worlds**: Keep Portkey's benefits (caching, routing) while fixing the retry limitation

### Implementation Approach

The client-side retry implementation will:
- Detect 429 errors from Portkey response
- Parse retry-after headers (both seconds and HTTP date formats)
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter
- Respect long delays (up to 300 seconds)
- Use pure Effect-TS patterns for consistency
- Add comprehensive debug logging

### Configuration

Add to `config/portkey/config.json`:
```json
{
  "client_retry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_attempts": 5,
    "max_delay_ms": 300000,
    "initial_delay_ms": 1000,
    "backoff_multiplier": 2,
    "jitter_factor": 0.1
  }
}
```

### Alternative Considered

We considered switching to LiteLLM or Helicone, but the migration effort and potential disruption outweighed the benefits given that client-side retry is a straightforward solution that preserves our existing investment in Portkey configuration and integration.

### Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ 429 errors automatically retried client-side
- ‚úÖ Retry-after headers > 60 seconds properly respected
- ‚úÖ Integration tests pass in parallel mode
- ‚úÖ Clear debug logging shows retry behavior
- ‚úÖ Maintains pure Effect-TS patterns

## Risks and Mitigations

### Phase 1 Risks
- **Breaking Changes**: Extensive refactoring may introduce regressions
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive test coverage and incremental changes
- **Runtime Environment Differences**: Test vs production environment discrepancies
  - *Mitigation*: Validate in actual runtime environment, not just tests

### Phase 2 Risks
- **External Dependency**: Adding Portkey gateway as infrastructure component
  - *Mitigation*: Self-hosted deployment with fallback to direct model calls
- **Configuration Complexity**: YAML/JSON routing rules may become unwieldy
  - *Mitigation*: Start simple, gradually add complexity as needed
- **Performance Overhead**: Gateway may add latency
  - *Mitigation*: Benchmark thoroughly, use local deployment to minimize latency

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **OpenRouter**: Excellent for hosted solution but lacks self-hosting control
2. **LangChain.js**: Too heavy for our focused routing needs
3. **LlamaIndex TS**: Better for data-heavy applications than pure routing
4. **Continue Custom Implementation**: Maintains current complexity without benefits of proven solutions

## Conclusion

The two-phase approach addresses both immediate runtime issues and long-term architectural goals:

**Phase 1** eliminates the hardcoded model reference anti-pattern that causes UI fallback issues and creates a foundation for proper model name routing.

**Phase 2** replaces our custom implementation with Portkey's production-grade gateway, providing advanced features like semantic caching, circuit breakers, and native observability integration.

This strategy allows us to quickly fix current issues while moving toward a more maintainable, feature-rich solution that aligns perfectly with our AI-native observability platform goals.
