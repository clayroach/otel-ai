# ClickHouse AI Prompt Strategy Analysis

## Official ClickHouse AI Approach vs Our Implementation

Based on the [official ClickHouse AI documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/AI/ai-powered-sql-generation), here's how our approach compares and what we should consider:

### Official ClickHouse AI Approach

#### Key Principles:
1. **Schema Discovery**: AI automatically discovers tables and schemas using built-in functions
   - `list_databases`
   - `list_tables_in_database` 
   - `get_schema_for_table`

2. **Self-Contained Queries**: Each prompt should be complete and contextual
   - No conversation history maintained
   - Full context provided in each request
   - One-shot query generation

3. **Clear Specifications**: Prompts should be specific about:
   - Time periods
   - Type of analysis desired
   - Specific filtering criteria

4. **Prompt Pattern**: "Can you tell me [specific analytical request] for [time period/context]?"

### Our Current Implementation

#### Strengths Aligned with ClickHouse Best Practices:
✅ **Complete Context**: We provide full schema definitions in each prompt
✅ **Specific Analysis Goals**: We include clear analysis objectives  
✅ **Time Period Specification**: We use specific time windows (15-minute intervals)
✅ **Self-Contained**: Each query generation is independent

#### Our Enhanced Approach Beyond Standard ClickHouse AI:

1. **Diagnostic-Focused**: We specifically optimize for observability and diagnostics
2. **Trace-Level Analysis**: We identify problematic traces first (not in standard approach)
3. **Multi-Tiered Requirements**: We have specific diagnostic requirements beyond basic SQL generation
4. **Health Scoring**: We add operational intelligence with CRITICAL/WARNING/HEALTHY categories

## Key Differences: SQL LLMs vs General ClickHouse AI LLMs

### For SQL-Specific Models (sqlcoder-7b-2, etc.)

**Our Approach:**
```typescript
// Concise, SQL-focused prompt
const sqlPrompt = `Generate a ClickHouse SQL query for diagnostic analysis:

Services: frontend, cart, checkout, payment, email
Goal: Analyze checkout flow latency patterns

REQUIRED SQL PATTERNS (use ALL of these):
1. TRACE-LEVEL ANALYSIS: 
   WITH problematic_traces AS (...)

2. ERROR ANALYSIS:
   countIf(status_code != 'OK') AS error_count

3. VOLUME CONTEXT:
   count() AS request_count

[Schema definition]
Return only SQL:`
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Direct SQL pattern injection
- ✅ Minimal explanatory text
- ✅ Focuses on specific SQL constructs
- ✅ Template-like structure
- ⚠️ May not work well with complex diagnostic requirements

### For General LLMs (Claude, GPT-4) via ClickHouse AI

**Our Approach:**
```typescript
// Comprehensive, context-rich prompt
const generalPrompt = `You are a ClickHouse expert specializing in DIAGNOSTIC queries.

Critical Path: E-commerce Checkout Flow
Services: frontend, cart, checkout, payment, email
Analysis Goal: Analyze checkout flow latency patterns

DIAGNOSTIC REQUIREMENTS (ALL MUST BE INCLUDED):
1. TRACE-LEVEL ANALYSIS: Identify problematic traces first using CTE
2. ERROR ANALYSIS: Include error rates and failure patterns
3. VOLUME CONTEXT: Include request counts to contextualize performance
[... detailed requirements]

QUERY STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Use CTEs for complex multi-level analysis
- Order results by severity/impact for immediate action
- Filter out low-volume noise
[... structural guidance]

[Complete schema definition]

Validation Rules:
- Query MUST help diagnose WHY this path is critical
- Must focus on problematic traces, not aggregate all data
[... validation requirements]

Return ONLY the SQL query without explanation.`
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Rich contextual information
- ✅ Explicit diagnostic requirements
- ✅ Detailed structural guidance
- ✅ Validation criteria
- ✅ Better for complex diagnostic scenarios

## Comparison with Official ClickHouse AI

### Where We Align:
1. **Schema Provision**: Like ClickHouse AI, we provide complete schema information
2. **Context Richness**: We include full context in each request
3. **Specific Goals**: We clearly define what type of analysis is needed
4. **Self-Contained**: Each generation is independent

### Where We Extend Beyond Standard ClickHouse AI:

1. **Diagnostic Specialization**: 
   - **Standard**: General SQL generation for analytics
   - **Our Approach**: Specialized for observability diagnostics with trace-level analysis

2. **Multi-Model Strategy**:
   - **Standard**: Typically uses one model approach
   - **Our Approach**: Different prompting for SQL-specific vs general models

3. **Requirements Framework**:
   - **Standard**: Flexible, analysis-driven
   - **Our Approach**: Structured diagnostic requirements (error analysis, health scoring, etc.)

4. **Validation Integration**:
   - **Standard**: Basic SQL validation
   - **Our Approach**: Diagnostic-specific validation with pattern matching

## Recommended Improvements Based on ClickHouse AI Best Practices

### 1. Enhanced Schema Discovery
Consider implementing dynamic schema discovery similar to ClickHouse AI:

```typescript
// Future enhancement: Dynamic schema discovery
const discoverSchema = async (table: string) => {
  // Could integrate with ClickHouse DESCRIBE or INFORMATION_SCHEMA
  return getTableSchema(table)
}
```

### 2. Clearer Prompt Structure Following ClickHouse Pattern

**Current SQL Model Prompt**: Mixed diagnostic requirements with SQL patterns
**Improved**: More aligned with ClickHouse's clear request pattern

```typescript
// More ClickHouse AI aligned approach
const clickHouseStylePrompt = `
Analyze checkout flow performance showing error rates and latency bottlenecks for services: frontend, cart, checkout, payment, email over the last 15 minutes.

Requirements:
- Focus on traces with errors or high latency (>1000ms)
- Group by service and operation
- Include error percentages and 95th percentile latency
- Order by total time impact for triage

Table: traces
[Schema definition]

Generate ClickHouse SQL:
`
```

### 3. Model-Specific Optimizations

#### For SQL Models (Following ClickHouse AI Simplicity):
- Use simpler, more direct prompts
- Focus on SQL pattern injection
- Minimize diagnostic complexity
- Provide concrete examples

#### For General Models (Enhanced Context):
- Rich diagnostic context
- Detailed requirements
- Validation criteria
- Comprehensive schema information

## Conclusion

Our approach is well-aligned with ClickHouse AI best practices but extends beyond them for specialized observability diagnostics. The key improvements we could make:

1. **Simplify SQL model prompts** to be more like ClickHouse AI's direct approach
2. **Enhance general model prompts** with even richer diagnostic context
3. **Consider dynamic schema discovery** for more flexible table handling
4. **Maintain clear separation** between simple analytics and complex diagnostics

The trace-level analysis approach we implemented goes beyond standard ClickHouse AI and provides significant diagnostic value that the standard approach lacks.
